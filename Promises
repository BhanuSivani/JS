Promise:
A promise is a special javasrcipt object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
it allows to handle asynchronous tasks more efficiently than call backs
Three States:
Pending: The initial state the promise is still wanting the operation to finish
Fulfilled:  The operation completed successfuly
Rejected: The operation failed

Explanation1:
to create a promise: new promise()
it takes two parameters:
resolve: to mark the promise as successful
reject: to mark it as failed
To handle the result: 
.then()
it is called when the promise is fullfilled
it will receive the result from parameter
.catch()
This method is called if the promise is rejected
chaining promises:
Example2: promise with setTimeOut
asynchronous task using setTimeout and the promise will resolve after a certain amonut of time
