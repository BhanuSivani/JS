to make the set of instructions(block of code)(conditional block)execute only when the given condition is true
Used to decide whether the code has to be executed or skipped based on the given condition

BLOCK OF CODE:
Set of instructions is called block of code
it executes only when that specific condition is true

EX: console.log(5>6)
Methods:
if
if is used for only one possible condition,if the condition is true the statement gets executed or gets skipped
